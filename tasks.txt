- Implement neural network properly in Keras
- Benchmark LAR vs LAR+NNet vs LAR+eeRTree performance
- Write paper comparing SL2P vs LAR vs LAR+NNet estimates for biophysical variables
- Read Najib's ALR paper and MATLAB code
- Implement cross validation to determine when to stop LARs
    - 10 blocks of input data, determine RMSE for each, min RMSE and STDEV of RMSEs
